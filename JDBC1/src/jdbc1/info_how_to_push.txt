Create project called JBC1 to match this structure.

Put these files in the project folder under the jbdc1 class (not sure how pull
or clone works)

Then for updating when you make changes use the following steps:
1. "add" file(s) by using add option under team
2. "commit" file(s) using commit option under team
3. "push" changes using push option (or push upstream for single click action) 
    under team->remote
    
    edit to test
